## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes for QA, how to run app locally

1. Download Node.js from: https://nodejs.org/en/download and install it.
2. Use GitExtensions to pull the repository
    - In GitExtension click start (top left corner) and select "Clone repository"
    - Paste the URL of the repo in the "Repository to clone" input field and click "Clone"
    - Click "Yes" when prompted to open the new repository
3. In the Console tab in GitExtensions type:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
    - npm start
    
   one after the other, NOT all at once. The app should now run on http://localhost:3000/
